# The use of DNS below effectively expands to:
#   PostUp = echo nameserver 10.192.122.1 | resolvconf -a tun.%i -m 0 -x
#   PostDown = resolvconf -d tun.%i
# If the use of resolvconf is not desirable, simply remove the DNS line
# and use a variant of the PostUp/PostDown lines above.
# The IP address of the DNS server that is available via the encrypted
# WireGuard interface is 10.192.122.1.
